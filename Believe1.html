					<p class='lineheight serif'>I believe that there should be no censorship of books.</p> 
					<p class='lineheight serif'>Throughout history, censorship of books has been a tool of oppressors. It has deprived those in need of knowledge of it, and caused knowledge to be lost to the world.</p> 
					<p class='lineheight serif'>Books have not just been banned because of the knowledge they contain, but the subject matter. Are some books written for older audiences, yes. But let the book speak for itself. If we truly wish to say that freedom of speech is available in this great land, then why are some books banned in some schools.</p> 
					<p class='lineheight serif'>These banned books are not just because of the intended audience. There still should be discretion. These books are banned because of content, and some of the requests are just blatant ignorance. Books like <i>The Bridge to Terabithia</i> have been banned because of “occult themes” (ALA banned book list). </p>
					<p class='lineheight serif'>We need to embrace these author’s stories. The all have a message to tell, whether in a story of pure fantasy, inspiring courage and whisking young readers away on a journey of the heart, giving them the details and letting their imagination supply the pictures for the journey, or a story with a more defined message such as <i>The Bridge to Terrabithia</i> that gives a message of hope.</p>
