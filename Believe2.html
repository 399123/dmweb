					<p class='lineheight serif'>But perhaps some of these powerful books should be banned. After all, there is no faster way to garner interest in something than to outlaw it. It takes what was little known before, and publicizes it. Banning something takes a book and assigns it a certain notoriety, a mystique of what the contents contained that was so horrifying and offensive that we cannot read it.</p>
					<p class='lineheight serif'>Still this is not a reason. Books are powerful tools, allowing people to visit many places, experience all new things, to loose themselves as they have never lost themselves before. Books allow for imagination to bloom, and for people to become what they want. They allow for the exploration of a world never before seen.</p>
					<p class='lineheight serif'>When we ban a book, we send a message. This message is sent to the author, and to the general public. It says that we believe that this book is inappropriate for reading. We are saying that your work is to offensive, or not in line with our beliefs. Thus no one can read your book. For a country that claims to love our freedoms, we sure think we know what is best for our neighbors to read. What books are best for them to enjoy in their spare time.</p>
					<p class='lineheight serif'>Let us take a stand, and prevent this tragic miscarriage of our beloved first amendment. Let us prevent the banning and the removal of books from our childrenâ€™s eyes. Let parents themselves decide if a book is appropriate. Let us not decide for others, but instead let them decide for themselves.</p>
